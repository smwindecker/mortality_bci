\begin{abstract}
Tree death is a fundamental process driving population dynamics, nutrient cycling, and evolution within plant communities. While past research has identified factors influencing tree mortality across a variety of scales -- including an individual's past growth, species-level functional traits, and temporal plot-scale effects; these distinct drivers are yet to be integrated within a cohesive and predictive framework. Here we apply classic survival analysis techniques within a cross-validated hierarchical Bayesian framework to derive instantaneous mortality functions that integrate individual, species, and plot-level effects for 203 tropical rain forest tree species at Barro Colorado Island (BCI) Panama. We show that mortality models that separate growth-dependent and growth-independent components, use stem diameter growth rather than basal-area growth, and attribute the effect of wood density to growth-independent death, outperform alternative formulations. Moreover, we show that the effects of wood density -- a prominent trait known to influence tree mortality -- explains only a small proportion of the total variability in species mortality rates, and that temporal variation in mortality was large.  Our analysis also suggests that growth-dependent processes -- and thus competition -- predominate as the biggest driver of mortality at BCI. Combined, this study provides a framework for predicting individual-level mortality in highly diverse tropical forests, but also highlights how little we now about the causes of species-level and temporal plot-scale effects, needed to effectively predict tree mortality.

\dropcap{R}ates of plant mortality are known to be highly variable among individuals, among coexisting species, between forests and from year-to-year [refs]. This variation has considerable consequences for forest structure and dynamics. Death of a single large tree can transfer up to 20000 kg of carbon from live-to-decaying carbon pools (Chave et al 200X), while at the same time opening up a gap that restarts a successional race, during which 10's-100's more plants may die while competing for a spot in the sun. In models of forest dynamics, variation in mortality rates has been found to have a larger impact on forest structure than absolute growth rates \cite{Johnson-2016}. As such, improving our ability to understand the mortality process is therefore a priority for making skilful predictions about forest dynamics and carbon, water or nutrient cycles; especially in an era of rapid environmental change.

Two substantial challenges exist when studying tree mortality in tropical rainforests. The first is that large population sizes and long periods of observation are required to make inferences into how various factors affect mortality rates. This requirement arises in part because the observable outcome -- alive vs. dead -- is one-step removed from the variable we ideally want to measure: $\lambda_i(t)$, the instantaneous rate of mortality for individual $i$ at time $t$ (also called a hazard rate). In classic survival analysis \cite{Kleinbaum:2012tn}, the probability that an individual dies between times $t_2$ and $t_3$ is expressed as a function of $\lambda_i(t)$:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mortality_model}
p_{i,t_2\rightarrow t_3} = 1 - \exp\left(- \int_{t_2}^{t_3} \lambda_i(t) {\rm d}t\right).
\end{equation}
Here $\int_{t_2}^{t_3} \lambda_i(t) {\rm d}t$ is the ``cumulative hazard'' between $t_2$ and $t_3$ \cite{Kleinbaum:2012tn}. The observed survival outcome $S_{i, t_2\rightarrow t_3}$ (0 = alive, 1 = died) is then a realisation of this probability
\begin{equation}
S_{i,t_2\rightarrow t_3} \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(p_{i,t_2\rightarrow t_3}).
\end{equation}
Since trees are generally long-lived, and because we are trying to estimate the shape of a continuous function from binary data, large sample-sizes are required. As such, detailed studies of forest tree mortality have only recently become possible, with the accumulation of growth and survival data from repeat surveys in long-term monitoring plots containining thousands of individuals and spanning several decades \cite{Anderson-Teixeira-2015a}.

The other major challenge when studying mortality -- similar to that faced in other fields like medicine and engineering -- is to derive suitable shapes for the underlying instantaneous mortality (hazard) function that accurately reflect observed patterns in mortality. Past research has identified a range of factors with significant effects on tree survival, including an individual's growth rate, traits, and size (XX). Generally, however, these influences have not been formalised as hazard functions (XX). Yet such functions are critical for forecasting temporal patterns in tree mortality, and consequently, changes in ecosystem function (XX). This is because hazard functions explicitly define the instantaneous rate of death per unit time and consequently provide vital information on when a death is likely to occur and how various covariates affect this.

A particular challenge is to integrate the observed conflicting relationships between mortality and growth observed within and across species. Within species, mortality rates tend to decrease for faster growing individuals, presumably because those individuals have superior carbon budgets and are thus better able to tolerate or repair diverse stresses \cite{Kobe:1995tw, Hawkes:2000ib, Keane:2001db}. Empirical studies provide broad support, with many highlighting non-linear declines in mortality with increased growth \cite[e.g.][]{Kobe:1997vy, Wyckoff:2002ul,Vieilledent:2010fv}. Yet across species, there tends to be a strong trade-off between growth and survival, with individuals from faster growing species having higher mortality than individuals from slower growing species \cite{Poorter:2008iu, Wright:2010fl}. This trade-off may arise via traits with antagonistic effects, such as wood density (biomass per unit wood volume). Denser wood -- which is more expensive to build and thus slows growth rates -- conveys enhanced physical strength, reduced stem breakage \cite{Putz:1983wu,vanGelder:2006exa,Chave:2009iy}, embolism \cite{Hacke:2001kj, Jacobsen:2005fx}, fungal or pathogen attack \cite{Augspurger:1984wx}, and ultimately reduced mortality \cite{Poorter:2008iu, Chave:2009iy, Kraft:2010kq, Wright:2010fl}.

A) Our data consist of repeat measures of stem diameter ($D$) and status ($S$, alive or dead) for individual trees at specific census dates ($t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$).
B) We consider three alternative hazard functions: 1) a baseline hazard, 2) a growth-dependent hazard; and 3) a function that combines both baseline and growth-dependent hazards. The parameters of the models are biologically interpretable: $\alpha$ defines the instantaneous mortality rate at low growth rate; $\beta$ reflects the sensitivity of mortality rate to changes in growth rate; and $\gamma$ is the asymptote, or baseline hazard. Combined $\alpha$ and $\beta$ capture growth-dependent mortality, while $\gamma$ captures growth-independent mortality (e.g. windfall, fire) that kill a plant irrespective of its growth rate. For each model form, we consider two alternative predictors of growth, $X$ (basal area and stem diameter growth), as well as allowing for species-level effects on the parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$.

Alternative models were fit 10 times ($M_1$, ..., $M_{10}$), using different combinations of testing and training data. We then average the estimated log loss for each of these 10 model fits.}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

In this study, we reconcile both intraspecific and interspecific drivers of instantaneous mortality by developing a unified model that incorporates individual-level, species-level, and plot-level effects, within a cross-validated hierarchical Bayesian framework. To derive this unified model, we compare the predictive accuracy of three alternative cumulative hazard functions ($\lambda_i(t)$; Fig. \ref{fig1}B) in predicting patterns of tropical tree mortality in 203 tropical rainforest trees at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. The simplest model (Fig. \ref{fig1}B, left), assumes a single baseline hazard, which is constant irrespective of a plant's growth rate. The second model (Fig. \ref{fig1}B, middle) describes a growth-dependent hazard which assumes the risk of dying eventually declines to zero as growth increases. 

Following past work \cite[e.g.][]{Kobe:1995tw, Wyckoff:2000un, Kunstler:2005bn, Vieilledent:2010fv}, we assume the growth-mortality relationship is adequately captured by a negative exponential curve, with mortality decaying exponentially until an asymptote at zero is reached. The third model (eq. Fig. \ref{fig1}B, right) is the summation of the two previous models. Specifically, this model allows $\lambda_i(t)$ to decrease exponentially with increasing growth rate, but, unlike a standard negative exponential, will asymptote at some baseline hazard instead of zero. The advantage of this model is that it effectively accounts for two independent causes of mortality: death due to growth and death due to chance (i.e. stochastic events such as wind throw and fire). Combined, these three models capture a variety of functional responses previously proposed, including effects represented in current vegetation models (Moorcroft 2001). However, these alternative models have not previously been systematically compared.

In deriving the unified model, we address the following specific questions:
\begin{enumerate}\itemsep 0pt
  \item Does mortality vary substantially between censuses?
  \item Does a mortality function including both growth-dependent and independent terms outperform a model including only one of these?
  \item Which growth measure (diameter increment growth or area growth) best captures growth-dependent mortality?
  \item Does including wood density improve model predictive capacity, and if so, does it predominately affect baseline hazard, growth-dependent hazard or both?
  \item What is the proportion of inter-specific variability explained by wood density?
  \item What is the proportion of total variability explained by species, census, baseline hazard and growth-dependent hazard?
\end{enumerate}
Answering these questions involves comparing predictive accuracy of alternative models. To achieve this, we used K-fold cross-validation (Fig. \ref{fig1}D). Cross-validation is a typical approach to model evaluation, and assesses a modelâ€™s accuracy when extrapolating to data not used in model calibration, thereby indicating the modelâ€™s true predictive accuracy \cite{Hooten:2015, Stone:1997tg}. Evaluating models in this way is computationally expensive, making it virtually impossible to run all combinations. For example, some of our models took over a two weeks to complete. We therefore fit models across five iterative stages of model fitting and comparison, corresponding to the six questions evaluated above, and gradually increasing model complexity (see methods).

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Mortality strongly varies over time}
Tree mortality progressively decreased over time. Between 1995 and 2010, the highest proportion of trees dying between 1995\textendash 2000 (\Sexpr{prop_deaths(BCI_model_dataset_true_unique, 1)}\%) followed by 2000\textendash 2005 (\Sexpr{prop_deaths(BCI_model_dataset_true_unique, 2)}\%) and lastly 2005\textendash 2010 (\Sexpr{prop_deaths(BCI_model_dataset_true_unique, 3)}\%). Consequently, when we allowed hazard rates to be scaled by census (i.e. adding term $\delta$) we observed a significant increase in predictive accuracy (i.e. lower logarithmic loss; Fig. \ref{fig2}A). Assuming the long-term average census effect ($\delta$) is 1, then our model predicted deaths were \Sexpr{census_effects(final_model,1)}\% higher in 1995\textendash 2000, and \Sexpr{census_effects(final_model,2)}\% and \Sexpr{census_effects(final_model,3)}\% lower in 2000\textendash 2005 and 2005\textendash 2010, respectively.

\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Growth hazard functions}
We found that the hazard function that incorporates both growth-dependent and baseline hazard terms (i.e. $(\alpha e^{\beta X_{i}} + \gamma)\delta$) and used stem diameter growth rather than basal-area growth, significantly outperformed both the baseline only (i.e.$\gamma \delta$) or growth-dependent only (i.e. $(\alpha e^{\beta X_{i}})\delta$) hazard functions (Fig. \ref{fig2}A). Surprisingly, we found that the growth-dependent only function did not improve predictive capacity over the baseline only function. Furthermore, we found that while the hazard function that incorporates both baseline and growth-dependent terms significantly improved model accuracy, this was only apparent if dbh growth was used.

\label{fig3}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Effect of wood density on mortality rates}
The inclusion of wood density on either baseline or growth-dependent parameters significantly improved model accuracy relative to a hazard function without such effects (Fig. \ref{fig2} A,B). The most parsimonious combination that provided the largest gain in predictive accuracy (i.e. lowest logarithmic loss) occurred when only the baseline hazard term ($\gamma$) was varied as a function of species wood density ($\rho$; Fig. \ref{fig2} B). We found that wood density was negatively correlated with species baseline mortality rate (Fig. \ref{fig3}). This meant that species with low wood density had on average higher growth-independent mortality rates ((Fig. \ref{fig4} A,B), and thus higher annual probability of death (Fig. \ref{fig4} C,D), relative to high wood density species. While, wood density did improve model accuracy it only accounted for XX\% of the total gain in predictive capacity that could be obtained by accounting for species differences.

\subsection*{Proportion of variation explained}
Predicted mortality rates were most variable between species accounting for approximately XX\% followed by between census periods (accounting for XX\%). Wood density, a species level trait, accounted for approximately XX\% of the total species variability, suggesting that other species differences contribute to the ramaining XX\% unexplained species variation.

As expected, the growth-dependent hazard terms (i.e. the part of the model allowed to vary by individual growth) accounted for XX\% of the overall variation in mortality rates while the baseline (growth-independent) hazard accounted for XX\%.

\label{fig4}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Mortality rates, species light requirements and species maximum dbh}
We found that both $\alpha$, the effect of low growth rate, and $\gamma$, the baseline hazard term, were positively correlated with gap index (our measure of species light requirement; Fig. \ref{fig6} A,C, E). By contrast, $\beta$ (the parameter that defines the exponential decay with increasing growth rate) was negatively correlated gap index. The combination of these correlations suggest that species that predominately recruit in gaps (i.e. higher gap index) were more prone to death due to both low growth stochastic chance and required faster growth rates for a given mortality rate relative to a species that readily recruits in non-gaps. We detected no strong correlations between estimated species parameters and their associated maximum DBH (Fig. \ref{fig6} B,D,F,H).

- General overview of results:
As expected, the most biologically reasonable model; the model with both a baseline hazard and growth-dependent hazard was the best predictor of tropical tree mortality, indicating that both growth dependent and independent hazards are needed to effectively model tree mortality. 

- Furthermore, we found that DBH was by far the better growth measure for predicting plant mortality.
	- Why DBH? Could it be that DBH implicitly punishes smaller individuals relative to larger individuals. That is, small plants can only gain a small amount of DBH growth relative to a larger plant. As such, DBH growth implicitly captures the process whereby small individual plants are more prone to competitive effects as well as random breakage events caused by trampling, herbivory etc.

- As expected, when allowing parameters to vary by species we found a significant improvement in model predictive capacity.
		- This supports previous research that shows that species vary substantially in mortality rates.

- When examining this interspecific variability we found that the effect of wood density improved model predictive capacity when it was included on the base-line hazard, with only marginal improvements when included on all three parameters.

- Furthermore, we found that wood density explained XX\% of the total species variation for the baseline hazard.

- Conclusion, species with higher wood density had lower baseline hazards supporting previous work that suggests that these species are less prone to stochastic events that involve breakage etc.

\subsection*{Data}
We parametrized plant mortality models using individual growth and survival data \cite{Condit:2012nz} collected from a relatively undisturbed 50-ha tropical rainforest plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama (9.15\textdegree;N, 79.85\textdegree;W). The climate on the island is warm throughout the year with a mean annual temperature of 26.1\textdegree and rainfall is seasonal with most of the 2500 mm falling between April and November. BCI is managed exclusively for field research by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) and the permanent plot was established in 1980. Detailed descriptions on the flora, fauna, geology and climate of BCI can be found in (REF).

Within the 50-ha plot the diameter at breast height and survival status of all free-standing woody plants that were at least 1.3 m tall and had diameter $\geq$ 1 cm were recorded in 1981-1983, 1985, and every 5 years thereafter \cite{Condit:2012nz}. For the purpose of modelling mortality as a function of growth, we discarded data collected in 1982 and 1985 because diameter measurements were rounded to the nearest 5 mm whereas later censuses were rounded to the nearest millimetre. We also excluded individuals based on the following rules: 1) those that did not survive at least two censuses (two being required to estimate growth rate); 2) those that were not consistently measured at 1.3 m above ground; 3) those that were multi-stemmed; 4) those that resprouted or \textit{``returned from the dead''}; or 5) extreme outliers -- stems which grew more than 5 cm/yr or shrunk more than 25\% of their initial diameter. We also discarded species that do not exhibit secondary growth (e.g. palms and ferns), contained fewer than 10 individuals or did not contain an estimate of wood density.  In order to maintain statical independence of measurements, we then sub-sampled this dataset by randomly selecting one observation per individual out of a possible three censuses. In total, \Sexpr{n_inds(BCI_model_dataset_true_unique)} individuals of \Sexpr{n_spp(BCI_model_dataset_true_unique)} species were included in our analysis.

Wood density for each species was estimated by coring trees located within 15 km of the BCI plot, because increment borers are prohibited within the plot itself \cite{Wright:2010fl}. Cores were broken into pieces, each 5 cm long and specific gravity of each piece was determined by oven drying (100\textdegree C) and dividing by the fresh volume (as measured by water displacement). Wood density was then calculated as an area-weighted average (g cm$^-3$), where area refers to the annulus represented by each piece, assuming a circular trunk.

\subsection*{Estimating true growth}

Field measurements of diameter inevitably include observation error, errors that may ultimately bias conclusions. In our dataset, \Sexpr{prop_neg_growth(BCI_model_dataset_true_unique)}\% of observed growth rates were negative. While there are physiological processes (e.g. water depletion and bark drop) that can lead to trunk shrinkages overtime \cite{Pastur:2007kl}, it is biologically impossible for growth (i.e. the creation of new biomass) to be negative \cite{Clark:2007ve}. To ensure our model was not biased by these implausible values we estimated \textit{``true growth''}(i.e. observed growth minus observation error) by first using another BCI dataset collected explicitly to examine observation errors \cite{Condit:2012nz}. This dataset consisted of \Sexpr{nobs_meas_err_data(BCI_dbh_error_data)} randomly selected trees that had their diameter measured twice within a 30 day period \cite{Condit:2012nz}. Assuming no growth occurred over this period, any discrepancy in measurements can be attributable to observation error. The standard deviation of these discrepancies was estimated to be \Sexpr{obs_error_sigma(BCI_dbh_error_data)}, meaning that 95\% of the measurement errors were within $\pm$ 1.47 cm of the true diameter. Having an estimate of observation error, we then used Bayesian point estimation to maximize the joint posterior of the \textit{``true''} initial and final diameter, and subsequently, \textit{``true growth''} for each individual (SUPP).

\subsection*{Estimating mortality rates}
At each stage, the best model from the previous stage was taken as input for the next stage. Specifically, stage 1 fitted the simplest model (Fig. \ref{fig1}B) and compared it to the same model but one which varied by census. This allowed us to determine whether $\lambda$ significantly varied over-time and thus whether accounting for it improved predictive capacity. Stage 2 involved comparing predictive performance of the three $\lambda$ models described in (Fig. \ref{fig1}B) using either annual diameter increment or area growth rates. This allowed us to determine: 1) whether predictive performance was substantially improved with increasing functional complexity; and 2) whether predictive performance varied by growth measure. In stage 3, we begin to examined inter-specific variability by using the best model of stage 2 but allowing various combinations of parameters to vary as a function of species wood density. This allowed us to determine if wood density improved predictive capacity, and if so, whether it predominately improved predictive capacity via growth-dependent or growth-independent processes. Stage 4 also examined inter-specific variability, however, here the focus was on using the best model of stage 2 and estimating the total predictive gain obtained if all parameters were allowed to vary as a function of species ID. The last stage was fitting the best model, with species random effects and wood density to the entire dataset (i.e. not cross validated). This allowed us to examine the range of species hazard curves, how they are affected by wood density, census and posthoc covariates, and the proportion of predicted variation explained by species, wood density, census and growth-dependent and baseline hazard terms.



The most complicated function is
\begin{equation}
\lambda_i = \big(\underbrace{\alpha \, \exp\left(-\beta \, X_i \right)}_{\text{Growth-dependent}} +  \underbrace{\gamma}_{\text{Baseline}}\big) \underbrace{\delta_t}_{\text{Census-effect}}.
 \label{add_haz}
\end{equation}


\subsection*{Model fitting}

For all models we used Bayesian inference and fitted models in R \Sexpr{paste(version$major, version$minor, sep='.')} using package \texttt{rstan} \Sexpr{packageVersion("rstan")}\cite{StanDevelopmentTeam:2015uz}. We executed three independent chains and in all cases modelled parameters converged within 2000 iterations. Convergence was assessed through both visual inspection of chains and reference to the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin convergence diagnostic \cite{Gelman:1992ts, Brooks:1998ju}. After discarding the first 2000 iterations as â€˜burn inâ€™, a further 2000 iterations were taken from the joint posterior.

\subsection*{Model evaluation}
Predictive accuracy was quantified by estimating the average log loss across K-folds for held-out data, $\bar{\mathcal{L}}$ (Fig. \ref{fig1}). Logarithmic loss -- commonly known as log loss, and indicated by $\mathcal{L}$-- measures the accuracy of a model by penalizing incorrect predictions based on how wrong the predicted probability is from the observed outcome (Fig ??). By minimizing the $\bar{\mathcal{L}}$, we maximize predictive skill. The average log loss across all individuals for the $k$th fold of held-out data, $\mathcal{L}_k$, is given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:logloss}
\mathcal{L}_k = - \frac1{N_k}\,\sum_{i=1}^{N_k}\big(S_i\,\log(p_{i,t_2\rightarrow t_3}) + ( 1 - S_i)\,\log(1 - p_{i,t_2\rightarrow t_3})\big),
\end{equation}
where $N_k$ refers to the number of observations in fold.
