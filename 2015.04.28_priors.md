##Model description

\begin{equation} \label{eq:lambda}
\lambda_i =
\left(
\overbrace{\exp\left(a\_log_i - \exp(b\_log_i) \times
\frac{\textrm{growth}_i}{2 \times \sigma_{growth}}
\right)
}^{\text{Growth dependent hazard}} +
\overbrace{\exp(c\_log_i)
}^{\text{Growth independent hazard}}\right)
\end{equation}

Here, 
$a_log$ defines the intercept when growth rate = 0. In other words, it describes the instantaneous mortality rate when growth rate = 0; 
$b_log$ is the rate of exponential decline in growth dependent mortality per unit growth rate increment.
$c_log$ defines the asymptote when growth rates are high enough that they no longer influence mortality rates. i.e. It describes the growth independent mortality hazard.

These three parameters are each estimated using linear models with varying intercepts for both species ID and census period:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:x_log}
x\_log_i = x0_{s[i]} + x1_{c[i]} + x2 \times \frac{(\log(\rho_{s[i]}) -\mu_{\log(\rho)})}{2 \times \sigma_{\log(\rho)}}
\end{equation}

Where, $x0_{s[i]}$ and $x1_{c[i]}$ are the random intercepts associated with species ID and Census period, respectively. $x2$ is the effect of the log centered and standardised $\rho$.


##ISSUE 1: Alternatives to current standardising procedure of rho & growth measure.

Currently we are centering and scaling rho using the following transformation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rho_standardization}
\frac{(\log(\rho_{s[i]}) -\mu_{\log(\rho)})}{2 \times \sigma_{\log(\rho)}}
\end{equation}

We do this because:
1) Because it puts all predictors on the same scale allowing effect sizes to be directly compared between different predictors (here: dividing by 2 SD instead of 1 SD also allows for comparison with binary predictors)
2) Improves computational efficiency by having all predictors on a similar scale that is closer to zero.
3) centering allows other terms (especially the intercepts) to be interpreted as 'the effect at mean $\rho$', as opposed to when $\rho = 0$, which is biologically implausable.

We log transform $\rho$ because:
The general model described above assumes $\rho$ is on the log scale. We used the log scale as opposed to the raw scale because it improves model stability by reducing over or underflow associated logging an exponential, especially if parameters are outside of (-700,700). see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/stan-users/NQ0xiAxqaww).

*The problem*
Daniel thinks that the current standardization approach is more difficult to interpet as the covariate is more difficult to back transform (i.e. $\rho = cs\_ln\_\rho \times (2 \times \sigma_{\log(\rho)}) + \mu_{\log(\rho)}$). It also makes it more difficult to determine approriate priors... and making predictions to other datasets require the fitted mean and SD of $\rho$.

Since we are not comparing $\rho$ to any other covariate the neccesity of standardizing for comparing effect sizes is not warranted. As such, we don't neccesarily need to divide by one or two standard deviations. We do however need to center $\rho$ because this allows intercepts to be interpeted at mean wood density as opposed to zero wood density.

As such, a suggested change is that, $\rho$ will only be centered on its mean or some other agreed value (i.e. $\log(\rho_{s[i]}) -\mu_{\log(\rho)}$). We believe, this should not alter computational efficiencies (hopefully!).

The growth rate predictor is also standardized using:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:growth_std}
\frac{\textrm{growth}_i}{2 \times \sigma_{growth}}
\end{equation}

Since we are not comparing to binary covariates, and because it simplifies subsequent analysis, will only standardize growth rate by 1 standard deviation.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:growth_std_new}
\frac{\textrm{growth}_i}{\sigma_{growth}}
\end{equation}

This means the model form will now be:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:lambda2}
\lambda_i =
\left(
\overbrace{\exp\left(a\_log_i - \exp(b\_log_i) \times
\frac{\textrm{growth}_i}{\sigma(\textrm{growth})}
\right)
}^{\text{Growth dependent hazard}} +
\overbrace{\exp(c\_log_i)
}^{\text{Growth independent hazard}}\right)
\end{equation}

Where $a\_log_i$, $b\_log_i$ and $c\_log_i$ are each estimated using linear models of the following functional form:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:x_log2}
x\_log_i = x0_{s[i]} + x1_{c[i]} + x2 \times (\log(\rho_{s[i]}) -\mu_{\log(\rho)})
\end{equation}


##ISSUE 2: Using more informative priors

Currently, $x2$ and the varying intercept hyperparameters $x0_mu$, $x0_sigma$, $x1_mu$, $x1_sigma$ associated with species and census are estimated using the default priors in stan,(e.g. $x0_mu ~ unif(-\infty, \infty)$. The issue with these uninformative priors is that they allow stan to sample regions of parameter space that are well outside that which is plausable. A consequence of this is that stan either fails to initialise or parameters take a very long time to converge (particularly with large datasets such as ours).

In order to improve model initialisation and sampling efficiency, we should use more informative priors based on either intuition or other datasets.

**Informative Priors for species random effect hyperparameters ($x0_mu$, $x0_sigma$) for a_log and c_log**
We can extract some information on the range of average species mortality rates [i.e. $a0[s]$ in our model] from Wright et al 2010, Chave et al 2008
Chave et al 2008: Fig 5b - mortality ranged from exp(3.1) to exp(-1.5) (check if this is yrly)
Poorter et al 2008: Fig 1 mortality/yr ranged from ~30% to 3%. (multiple forests)
Wright et al 2010: 
Wyckoff et al 2002: 7 species: table 4: mortality rates ranged from 15% to 0.9%.
Ruger et al 2011: annual mortality rates vary from ~ <1% to as much as ~ 6%

For example:
Wright 2010, showed that the proportion of deaths over a 5 year period for individuals growing in low light (i.e. growth rate ~0) varied across species, from approximately 5% to as much as 90%.
Based on the relationship between survival and hazard rate, $S =exp(-\lambda t)$,
where t=5 is census length, we can estimate the distribution of the instantenous hazard:

```{r}
t <- 5
S = c(5,90)/100
lambda = -log(S)/t
quantile(lambda,c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975))
```

This distribution provides prior knowledge for the range of $\lambda$ observed across species when growth is close to zero, (i.e.= $c\_log + a\_log$).
In this case, the observed range of $\lambda$ across species ranged 3.5 units in log space.
```{r}
abs(diff(log(lambda)))
```
or about a 30 fold variation in hazard rates across species.
```{r}
exp(abs(diff(log(lambda))))
```
## EXTRA thoughts
a0_mu ~ N(log(0.31),3) // spans 0.09% to 100%
c0_mu ~ N(log(0.31), 3) // spans 0.09% to 100%
a0_sigma ~ dunif(0, 2) // Individual species means can vary by the same amount
c0_sigma ~ dunif(0, 2) // Individual species means can vary by the same amount

```{r}
Sac <- function(mu = log(0.31), sd= 1){
c((1 - (exp(-exp(mu - (1.96*sd)))))*100,(1 - (exp(-exp(mu + (1.96*sd)))))*100)
}
```

```{r}
Sb <- function(mu = 0, sd= 1){
c((1-exp(-(exp(-2.9 - exp(mu - (1.96 *sd)) * 0.44))))*100,1-exp(-(exp(-2.9 - exp(mu + (1.96*sd)) * 0.44)))*100)
}
```

```{r}
sb <- function(mu=1) {
  curve((1-exp(-(exp(-2.75 - exp(mu) * x) + exp(-4))))*100, xlim=c(0,12), ylim=c(0,100),
      xlab=NA, ylab='Pr(Mortality)', xaxt='n', col='red')}
```


Using the above information, we can form informative priors for hyperparameters, $x0_mu$ & $x0_sigma$ associated with the species random effect $x0_s$ for both $a\_log$ and $c\_log$ linear models. Specifically, these priors should put $a\_log + c\_log$ in the same range of log space as mentioned above, $\lambda$  = 3.5.
Given this equates to a SD of 1 (i.e. 95% of observations from a normal distribution with 1 SD will occur in the range of mu -1.96, mu + 1.96) the species random effect prior can be specified as:

$x0_s \sim N(log(\lambda_50), 1)$
where, $\lambda_50$ = the median species mortality rate observed in Wright et al 2010 (i.e. 0.31).


**Census random effects for a_log and c_log**
We believe that the mean effect of census period on $\lambda$ will be close to zero, and will vary little among censuses. This is because we are averaging mortality rates over 5 year periods. We therefore, use the following prior for census random effects on a_log and b_log:

$x1_c /sim N(0, 0.05)$

Here, we use a SD of 0.05 because, we assume that the variance between censues in $lambda$ is unlikely to vary by more than 20% on yearly basis. 
If we assume that exp(x1) ranges from 0.9 - 1.1, then we can estimate an approrpiate sd in log space as (4 sd units gives 95% range)

> (log(1.1) - log(0.9))/4
[1] 0.05016767

This sigma_1 = 0.05.

For wood desnity effect, again we could expect up to 30 fold variation across species, i.e. 3.4 units in log space.
The range of log(wd/wdmean) is  about 1 unit in log space

> log(quantile(data$rho/mean(data$rho),c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975) ))
      2.5%        50%      97.5%
-0.6247548  0.0190453  0.3678112

Hence we could expect an effect size up to about 3.
We will assume that wood desnity does have an effect, but does not account for all species-level variation.

x2 ~ N(1,1)


For B

Expect no wd effect - i.e. mean of zero.
again, limited census-level effect

species effect - take priors from past published work, transfomring to suitable units.

Note also, prior may be different for different growth measures.
