From Wright 2010, we can estimate the range of instantanoeus mortality rates observed across species for individuals growing in low light (i.e. growth rate ~0) as

S = c(5,90)/100
k = -log(S)/5
 quantile(k,c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975) )
      2.5%        50%      97.5%
0.03552396 0.31010928 0.58469460  =
(This is derived assuming relationship S =exp(-kt) where t=5 is census length)

The above estimates are reasonable guesses for the range in k obesrved across species when growth is close to zero, i.e.= c+a.

The observed species effects ranged 3.4 units in log space,

> abs(diff(log(k)))
[1] 3.347556

this is equivalent to about 30 fold variation across species

> exp(abs(diff(log(k))))
[1] 28.43316


GENERAL model

X_log = x0[s] + x1[c] + x2 log_rhos

wher log_rhos = log(rho / rho_mn)

We've chosen this trnasformation so that it wd can easily be ineterpreted in back-transfromed model, and also so the log_rhos has mean of 0.


PRIORS

A and C

Priors on c and a should put c+a in the range of k above, as c+a is the mortality when growth is zero.

The range in log space of k is = 3.4. Given this equates to an SD of 1 (95% of a std normal will lie in range -2, 2) we have  a prior of

x10s] ~ N(log(k_50), 1)

We expect the mean effect of census to be close to zero, because we are averaging over longer time periods (5 years), thus

X1[c] ~ N(0, sigma_1)

sigma_1 was chosen so that limited variation among censuses, i.e. close to zero. If we allow us to 20% variance on yearly basis, i.e. exp(X1) ranges from 0.9 - 1.1, then we can estimate an approrpiate sd in log space as (4 sd units gives 95% range)

> (log(1.1) - log(0.9))/4
[1] 0.05016767

This sigma_1 = 0.05.

For wood desnity effect, again we could expect up to 30 fold variation across species, i.e. 3.4 units in log space.
The range of log(wd/wdmean) is  about 1 unit in log space

> log(quantile(data$rho/mean(data$rho),c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975) ))
      2.5%        50%      97.5%
-0.6247548  0.0190453  0.3678112

Hence we could expect an effect size up to about 3.
We will assume that wood desnity does have an effect, but does not account for all species-level variation.

x2 ~ N(1,1)


For B

Expect no wd effect - i.e. mean of zero.
again, limited census-level effect

species effect - take priors from past published work, transfomring to suitable units.

Note also, prior may be different for different growth measures.
