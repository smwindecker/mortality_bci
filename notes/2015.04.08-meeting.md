# Talk with NICTA team re mdoel fiiting and comparison

## 3 approaches to model building & their differences

Ecologists

- fit single large model, look for signifcant effects of parameters
- is asking how senssitive are model pars to data
- no penalty for complex models
- subjective judgments as to whether a parameter is significant enough to leave in model
- suited for partitioning of variance

Bayesian hypothesis testing

- compare probability of diff models
- how likely is one model relative to another?
- explicit penalty for complex models

Cross validation

- not trying to model system, just want a good predictor
- k-fold testing, break data into k groups, hold one group out and use for testing
- complexity penalty is implicit via overfitting (bc more complex models allows better fit to data), but this not necessarily case
	- rewards generalisation
	- models often have thousands of predictors, fine as long as does well on leave out data
