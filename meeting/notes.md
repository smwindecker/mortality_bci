# Agenda

Strengthen biological rationale

- work through, improve document
- start by addressing questions regarding maths
	- goal here is just to get framework right, then becomes background
	- somehow spent time debating framework, actually very flexible, allows us to incorporate any sort of biology
	- still some misunderstandings, clarify these, then put framework into background

Summary -- all about Hazard function, instantaneous rate of mortality with respect to covariates
	- proportional hazards is one type, but very retsrictive, not particularly helpful
	- much more flexible


# What else do we know

Covariates

	- size: dbh
	- traits: lma, wood density
	- growth rate: dbh, basal area,
